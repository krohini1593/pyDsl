=====

This is a Python Data Structures Library. It contains generic implementations for all types of common data structures and also for many uncommon ones. It will also contain implementations for many algorithms which are commonly needed.

The whole list of data structure which will be implemented can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

The list of algorithms which will be implemented can be found here: http://algorithm.daqwest.com/
Most of the useful algorithms will be implemented.
